% Random walk on the Markov chain
% Inputs:
% H - state transition matrix
% first - initial state
% last - terminal or absorving state
function state = crawl(H, first, last)
    % the sequence of states will be saved in the vector "state"
    % initially, the vector contains only the initial state:
    state = [first];
    % keep moving from state to state until state "last" is reached:
    while (1)
        state(end+1) = nextState(H, state(end));
        if (state(end) == last)
            break;
        end
    end
end

% Returning the next state
% Inputs:
% H - state transition matrix
% currentState - current state
function state = nextState(H, currentState)
    % find the probabilities of reaching all states starting at the current one:
    probVector = H(:,currentState)'; % probVector is a row vector
    n = length(probVector); %n is the number of states
    % generate the next state randomly according to probabilities probVector:
    state = discrete_rnd(1:n, probVector);
end


% Generate randomly the next state.
% Inputs:
% states = vector with state values
% probVector = probability vector
function state = discrete_rnd(states, probVector)
    U=rand();
    i = 1 + sum(U > cumsum(probVector));
    state= states(i);
